Attempt to fix camera angle bug when unmounted from flying mounts

So far, I know of only one person who had this bug where the camera angles focuses on character from a outwards persepective (ie: it fucks up camera angle when landing). If anyone has similar issues please try it out and tell me if it works. 

Work in Progress
